## Project Summary



*   Since i do not have any particular experience in Phyton or SQL language then i did have a lot of challanges<br> 
    regarding connecting to a database, creating a reaction based game, working with the different modules in the<br>
    python library, finding ways to protect the database inputs, creating an advanced command handler to have some<br>
    control over the different parts of the bot.
